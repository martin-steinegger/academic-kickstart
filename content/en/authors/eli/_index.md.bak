<h3>Intro</h3>

I am an independent scientist at ELKMO.  

Before that I was a postdoc with <a href="https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/soeding">Johannes SÃ¶ding</a> at <a href="https://www.mpinat.mpg.de/en">MPIBPC</a>, where I developed tools for the analysis of eukaryotic metagenomic data.  

Before that, I did my PhD at <a href="https://english.tau.ac.il/">TAU</a> under the joint supervision of <a href="https://m.tau.ac.il/~talp/">Prof. Tal Pupko</a> and <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~itaymay/">Prof. Itay Mayrose</a>, focusing on statistical techniques in molecular evolution.
