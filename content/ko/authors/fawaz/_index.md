### Intro
Fawaz did his Master's in Bioinformatics at the Saarland University and completed his PhD at the Heinrich-Heine University Düsseldorf under [Prof. Dr. Tobias Marschall](https://marschall-lab.github.io/) and [Prof. Dr. Olga Kalinina](https://www.helmholtz-hips.de/en/research/people/person/prof-dr-olga-kalinina/). His work mainly focused on developing command line tools in the field of genome graphs and pangenomics. For example, he developed [BubbleGun](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/17/4217/6633304) for fast detection of bubbles and superbubbles in large genome graphs, and [PanPA](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformaticsadvances/article/3/1/vbad167/7450145) for building, indexing and aligning panproteome graphs.

### Interests
Fawaz is generally interested in sequence alignment, genome graphs and pangenomes, specifically developing command-line tools that are easily installable and can be adapted in bigger pipelines.
